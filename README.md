# Abstract of Thesis

In this study, a simulation model is constructed based on Hallâ€™s body weight simulation model. In the first part, some simplifications and modifications are made on the original model, while maintaining validity. In the second part, a software (Mashap) is developed that automatically generates and runs a web based simulation game for any system dynamics model. Finally, the game generator is used to develop a web based game for the modified body weight dynamics model. Game generator will enable system dynamics researchers to build web based gaming environments for their own models.

# Abstract of Conference Paper

System Dynamics researchers need a software tool that makes the simulation games easy to access through web user interface. We developed a software (Mashap) that automatically generates and runs a web based simulation game for any system dynamics model. Our software has some important advantages over the existing ones: First, it is an open platform on which new tools can be built. Second, it is built for generating web games for all system dynamics modeling software. Mashap enables the system dynamics researchers to build web based gaming environments for their own models. The purpose of this paper is to introduce you to Mashap. To do this, I will show in detail how to use Mashap to develop a web based game for a body weight dynamics model.
